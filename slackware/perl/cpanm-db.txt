# It does not maintains a list of packages installed
# It relies on the user to remember the packages installed 
# uninstall process. We will also talk on how to install 
# the perl modules that are not in the slackbuilds.org
# perl comes with cpan manager in slackware. Run cpan as root in terminal,
# it would configure everything automatically. 
# Run cpan App::cpanminus it should install cpanm a perl module package manager
# it can install also uninstall packages.
# use cpan to install modules and cpanm to uninstall it.
# to install run cpan install JSON. 
# to uninstall cpanm -U JSON


# These packages are needed before installing any other modules: 

1. CPAN::DistnameInfo
2. YAML::Old
3. YAML::XS
